            In the summer of 2012, we were invited to the international Robocup Junior Championship in Mexico because we
            did well in RCJ China. The race was very important for us, so we bought the expensive metal omniwheels which
            provide great traction friction to make our new robots. Unfortunately, the CNC machine reached its life span
            when we were cutting boards for the robots, we had to give our blueprints to a shop and pay for these
            boards. Also, the new omniwheels seemed not to work well with our cheap motors, we couldn't change them
            because new motors need a new design and we didn't have time to do with that. We have to find out the value
            of motors which helped the robot to run in different angles manually. However, the other things were all
            fine and we still made the robots with good performance.
        </p>

            We arrived at Mexico on June 15th, there was still three days before the event started, so we went to some
            tourist attractions. We also did some testing about details of our robots in the hotel.

        <p class="contentText">
            On the first day of the event, there's no matches and we could test the robots in the new environment whole
            day. We saw many different kinds of robots with unique designs at that day, but we thought it's fine because
            of the comprehensive performance of our robots. However, we felt pressure when we saw team "Cenate 3G",
            which was the champion of last year, and team "EMM-CS", which was from Macau and beat us in Xi An. We made a
            mistake that we didn't take the ground color sensors, the white lines on the soccer fields were white and
            clear and we could detect them to help robots locate themselves if we had those sensors.
        </p>
        <p class="contentText">
            On the next day, we had three matches, it's not hard for us to win the match in the morning, but we met team
            "Cenate 3G" in the afternoon. We were really not sure about the result at that time, but the first match
            ended in a draw although we made some mistakes. After that, we changed some const in the program and even
            won team "Cenate 3G" by 22:9 in the second match. We were so happy about that because we made so great
            robots.

            On the third day, we met team "EMM-CS" in the morning ( someone's joke became truth ). At first, our robots
            had advantages on the field, but after a little while, one motor on our goalkeeper robot didn't work due to
            the broken welding spot on the circuit. We were not able to fix it immediately and finally lost the game.
            After that, there's nothing special until the last day.
        </p>
        <p class="contentText">
            On the last day of the championship, the superteam consisted of team "PTRT", team "NJRT" and us won all the
            matches and entered the finals successfully. We hoped our opponent would be one of "Cenate 3G" or "EMM-CS"
            in the second round so our superteam had chance to win. Unfortunately, our opponent was "the Rockys", that
            means our partner teams had to fight "Cenate 3G" and "EMM-CS", which were two of strongest teams in the
            championship. Finally, our superteam lost the game by 1:2, but we still got the second place in the
            championship. We were happy but felt a little regret because immersed in the joy of victory after winning
            the match between "Cenate 3G" but forgot to check everything of robot work fine after that. The result would
            be totally different if we checked that, but we thought there's no "if" in the world, the only thing we
            could do is not repeating the mistake in our life and that's what we learned in the Robocup Junior.
